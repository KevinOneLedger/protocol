/*
	Package contract provides functions for interacting with the OneLedger Protocol LockRedeem contract. It allows
	users to send over ethereum to lock their Ethereum.

	Note that this contract shouldn't be interacted with directly. Instead, users should lock their
	ETH by interacting with one of the public JSONRPC endpoints to ensure a transaction is created alongside a formal
	transaction created on the OneLedger Chain.
